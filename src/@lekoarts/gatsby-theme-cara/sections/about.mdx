## About
> We built a robot, that paired with our accompanying software, can sketch artwork.

By feeding the program several different assets, we can generate artwork that is truly unique.
Our first project, MarsRover takes in high quality images, audio files, and geographic coordinates to create
images that can be utilized to solve a puzzle. Prizes include full size prints, NFT's from other collections, and SOL.
